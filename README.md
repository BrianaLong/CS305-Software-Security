# CS305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial handels clients data and financial information that they use for investments. They seeked to have security tests ran on their software to ensure it is secure and to have vunrabilities addressed and fixed.
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I think I did well with the manual review of the code. I was able to find three classes that contained vunrablities within the code. It is important to code securly to ensure data is not leaked. Software security added to the companys value and intergrity to it's customers. Data breaches can cause the loss of clients due to a damaged repuatation.
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I found the interpreting client needs helpful to learn about. I did not know that there are no official government restrictions on secure communications and data outside of HIPPA.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Security is increased by encapsulating data. In the future I will still use manual code review first then run mitiagtion tests.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I made sure the code was secure and functional by running multiple tests.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I found everything done in this class to be new and useful to me. In the future I plan to make games and now I see the importance of security and how to add protections to important data.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show this document and particularly point out the manual code review as I see it is a good reflection of my skills by being able to asses the code by myself.
